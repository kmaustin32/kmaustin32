- 👋 Hi, I’m @kmaustin32. People call me Ezra these days, but Keenan works too in a pinch.
- 👀 I’m interested in JavaScript, Philosophy, Judaism, Psychology, and Dinosaurs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full Stack JS, with React and a little Python on the side.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can help with! I'm a beginner, give me a break!
- 📫  You can reach me via email @kmaustin32@yahoo.com
